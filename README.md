## Introduction:

The serverless icebreaker is a utility designed to analyze pre-built AWS Lambdas and mitigate cold start duration. Cold start duration can result in user experience issues, such as lengthy page loading times. By optimizing the size of the lambda build, you can reduce cold start duration and improve overall performance.

### Features

- `Lambda Size Analysis`: The Serverless icebreaker examines the file size of AWS Lambdas and identifies if the build is not compacted.
- `Library Usage`: It identifies the three most frequently utilized or imported libraries in the Lambda function.
- `Metrics Generation`: The tool generates metrics for all analyzed Lambdas, allowing you to monitor their sizes and track improvements over time.
- `Threshold Errors`: If a Lambda's size exceeds a specified threshold, the tool generates an error, indicating the need for optimization.
- `SST Framework Optimization`: The default configuration of the Serverless icebreaker is optimized for the [SST framework](https://sst.dev/), making it easy to integrate and use within your projects.

### [About cold start duration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/execution-environments.html#cold-start-latency)

![](img/chart.png)

The chart illustrates the correlation between lambda build size and cold start duration. As the lambda build size increases, the cold start duration also tends to be longer. This relationship highlights the importance of optimizing the lambda build size to reduce cold start latency and enhance overall performance.

Our mission is to minimize cold start duration and improve user experience. One of the most effective practices we recommend is optimizing your lambda build size

<table>
<tr><th>Lambda build size</th><th>Cold start duration</th></tr>
<tr><td>1 MB</td><td>150 ms</td></tr>
<tr><td>19.6 MB</td><td>692 ms</td></tr>
<tr style='color:red;'><td>30.2 MB</td><td>1716 ms</td></tr>
<tr style='color:red;'><td>52.8 MB</td><td>2515 ms</td></tr>
</table>

Here some [examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/static-initialization.html) how to optimize your lambda imports:

```
// Instead of const AWS = require('aws-sdk'), use:
const DynamoDB = require('aws-sdk/clients/dynamodb')

// Instead of const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk'), use:
const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk-core')

// Instead of const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk')), use:
const dynamodb = new DynamoDB.DocumentClient()
AWSXRay.captureAWSClient(dynamodb.service)
```

## Usage

![](img/sib-demo.gif)

### Icons:

- ‚úÖ - `SUCCESS` / The lambda build size is lower than the error threshold
- üöß - `WARNING` / The lambda build size is within 10% of the error threshold
- ‚ùå - `ERROR` / The lambda build size is higher than error threshold

### Installation:

```
npm install @theapexlab/serverless-icebreaker --save-dev
```

### Run:

```
npx sib
or
npm run sib
```

### Uninstall:

```
npm uninstall @theapexlab/serverless-icebreaker
```

## Behind the scenes

Upon first run, it creates a `sib-config.json` with the default settings for SST in the root of the project.

If the lambda is not minified on build time the imported node-modules are commented like this ` // node_modules/...` , so this app basically counts the occurrences of the same imports, and if the file size is over 20MB (can be changed in `sib-config.json`) the developer gets an error, and the three most used libs in the lambda.

## Configuration

The configuration file `sib-config.json` can be found at the root of the project. Here you can change a few things:

- `buildPath`: default folder where the built lambdas are located
- `searchTerm`: the start of the node_module comments to find
- `errorThresholdMB`: the maximum acceptable size of the lambda in megabytes
- `showOnlyErrors`: show only the files that exceed the error threshold
- `filterByName`: search filter for files
- `ignorePattern`: term, either complete or partial, to exclude from file names
- `detailedReport`: gives you a detailed report and the end

## Custom arguments

Search for something specific in a lambda's name:

```
npx sib --filterByName=get
```

Add string to ignore in file names:

```
npx sib --ignore-pattern=redis
```

Overwrite the error threshold:

```
npx sib --errorThresholdMB=30
```

To show only the files that exceed the error threshold:

```
npx sib --showOnlyErrors
```

To run a detailed report:

```
npx sib --detailed-report
```

To see all available options:

```
npx sib --help
```

## Pipeline Mode

When using the --pipeline flag, (a sib-config.json configuration file is required). In the absence of any errors, no output will be generated. However, if an error does occur, the program will exit with code 1.

This feature allows you to seamlessly integrate it into your existing pipeline, such as Husky or GitHub Actions, for efficient error handling and continuous integration.

For optimal results it is advisable to perform a build before very run.

```
npx sib --pipeline
or
npm run sib --pipeline
```

1. Add to [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run sib --pipeline"
```

2. Add to Github Action

```
jobs:
    ...
    steps:
    ...
      - name: sib
        run: npm run sib --pipeline
```
