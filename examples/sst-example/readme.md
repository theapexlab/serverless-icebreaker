# Usage with SST ⚙️

## How we set up the project:

``` 
This is a very basic SST project, without a frontend, we don't need one.
```

## Setting up the environment for testing
```
npm i
```
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run 
```

### We set up 4 lambdas
```
Simple, basic hello world without any imports
```
```
Long cold start, unoptimized, unused random imports that skyrockets file size
```
```
Unoptimized DynamoDB, imported the whole aws-sdk to use DynamoDB
```
```
Optimized DynamoDB, imported only the DynamoDB CLient from the AWS-SDK
```
